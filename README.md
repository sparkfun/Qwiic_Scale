This repo is the hardware repo for the Qwiic Scale.

Strain gauges are a lot of fun to play with but they often need complex conditioning and conversion ICs. Qwiic Scale takes care of all the hardware and software concerns and gets you measuring weight!

We've written an extensive Arduino library to make reading a load cell over I2C a breeze. Calibrate, get weight, and you're set.

This board is one of our many [Qwiic](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic) compatible boards! Simply plug and go. No soldering, no figuring out which is SDA or SCL, and no voltage regulation or translation required!

SparkFun labored with love to create this code. Feel like supporting open source hardware?
